## To run
``
chmod +x run_me.rb
``
then
``
./run_me
`` to run from the CLI

When asked for a file you must either enter the full filename relative to where you ran the file.

Or you can provide the full file path ```/example/path/to/file.txt```

The file name and path are case sensitive. 

If you choose to save the translation, it is saved to:

``
text.RPLT
``
